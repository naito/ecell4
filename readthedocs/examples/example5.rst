A Simple Model of the Glycolysis of Human Erythrocytes
======================================================

This is a model for the glycolysis of human erythrocytes which takes
into account ATP-synthesis and -consumption. This model is based on the
model introduced in the following publication.

   multienzyme systems. I. Modelling of the glycolysis of human
   erythrocytes.", Biosystems., 7, 1, 120-129.

   multienzyme systems. II. Steady state and transient control.",
